# Release and Profit Strategy for Varys

This document outlines the roadmap for distribution, monetization, and product evolution.

## 1. Distribution Options

*   Official Website: Host a simple landing page (Vercel/Netlify) with a "Download for Mac" button. Provides 100% control and 0% platform fees.
*   Gumroad / Lemon Squeezy: Use for selling digital goods, handling payments, VAT, and license keys.
*   GitHub Releases: Good for community building and open-source distribution.
*   Mac App Store: Consider only after established success due to $99/year fee, sandboxing restrictions, and 15-30% revenue cut.

## 2. Monetization Models

*   Pay What You Want: Best for initial user base building. Suggested starting price: $15.
*   One-Time Purchase: Recommended model for desktop utilities. Suggested price: $29 - $49 USD.
*   Freemium:
    *   Free: Download and Transcribe (Basic).
    *   Pro ($39): AI Summary, Obsidian Sync, Batch Processing.

## 3. Pricing Suggestion

*   Model: One-Time Purchase
*   Standard Price: $29 USD
*   Early Bird Price: $19 USD
*   Benefit: Pure profit due to zero server costs (local models).

## 4. Product Improvements (Roadmap)

*   Setup Wizard: One-click detection and guide for missing tools (Ollama, Whisper).
*   Library View: Built-in history of captured videos with covers and summaries.
*   Smart Clip Mode: Segment-specific transcription (e.g., "Clip from 10:00 to 12:00").
*   Format Expansion: Support for Notion, Tana, and PDF export.

## 5. Next Steps

*   Notarization: Acquire Apple Developer ID to sign the app and remove "Unverified Developer" warnings.
*   Landing Page: Develop a high-conversion site showcasing the "Voice to Insight" flow.
*   Launch: Promote on Product Hunt, Hacker News, and AI/Obsidian communities.
